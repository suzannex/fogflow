      <h2>Fog x Ebb x Flow</h2>
      <h3> Inspiration </h3>
      <p>
        Over the course of several visits to different FOG x FLO installations,
        I found myself repeatedly drawn to how the ebb and flow of park 
        visitors was changed, or unchanged, by the presence of the fog. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This flow was particularly fascinating to me at the FOG x Island
        site, where fog appears every half hour on a fairly heavily trafficked
        bicycle and pedestrian path. The fog sometimes drew significant
        attendance due to its accessible location, yet equally often, the fog
        was ignored by swaths of commuters, joggers, and dog walkers passing by.
      </p>

      <h3> Guide </h3>
      <p>
        I visited FOG x Island on different dates, at different times, and
        collected data on the people I observed passing through the park over 
        a period of time. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I recorded each individual's time of arrival, 
        time of departure, direction, and mode of transportation:  
        <span style="color:rgb(255, 195, 0)"> walking</span>, 
        <span style="color:rgb(255, 87, 51)"> running</span>, or 
        <span style="color:rgb(199, 0, 57)"> cycling</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each dot in these animations represents a single visitor, traveling
        along their path through the park.
